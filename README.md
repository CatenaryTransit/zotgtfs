## Instructions to get static data

download this damn thing:

https://api.transloc.com/gtfs/uci.zip

Now your Anteater static file is done!

# Notes

Previously, Transloc used a proprietary system that required conversion of all data. They switched to a different map and database technology, basically overhauled everything. for 2024, we rewrote the entire thing to use the provided GTFS file, and no longer generate our own timetable.

# Motivation

I want this data to show up on the rest of the Catenary

### Extra notes

Anteater Express / ASUCI is actually full of blockheads who are corrupt or are perpetually bitter for no reason. We got in trouble last year for "theft of services" aka pinging a public API for location data, and nearly got suspended. Genuinely worst organisation at any university.

If ASUCI poisons my lunch, I won't be surprised.
