# For devs

Hi Catenary contributors!

Anteater express has done it again and screwed us over! looks like they have an entirely new website now.

Your goal is to provide a function which returns Gtfs-rt. You can return the vehicles / trips seperately in the same struct, or put them in the same protobuf data structure. Up to you.

Documentation for GTFS-rt can be found here:
https://docs.rs/gtfs-rt/latest/gtfs_rt/
and here https://gtfs.org/

The rust crate for schedule gtfs is here: https://docs.rs/gtfs-structures

Good luck reverse engineering!
